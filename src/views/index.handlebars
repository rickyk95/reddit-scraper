            <h2>What is sentiment analysis?</h2>
            <p>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a computational technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. It involves analyzing and classifying text data to identify the underlying sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.The primary goal of sentiment analysis is to extract subjective information from text and understand the opinions, attitudes, and emotions of individuals or groups. It is widely applied in various domains, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, market research, brand reputation management, and political analysis.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The process of sentiment analysis involves several steps. Firstly, the text is preprocessed by removing noise, such as stopwords and punctuation. Then, the sentiment classification algorithm assigns sentiment scores or labels to the remaining text based on the presence and context of positive or negative words. Some advanced techniques also consider the intensity and polarity of sentiments.

        While sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights into public opinion, it is important to note that it has limitations. The accuracy of sentiment analysis heavily depends on the quality and diversity of the training data, the complexity of language, sarcasm, irony, and cultural nuances. Therefore, it is crucial to continuously refine and update sentiment analysis models to achieve more accurate results.</p>
